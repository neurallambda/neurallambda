# Neurallambda Class

class Neurallambda:
    """A Neurallambda is a datastructure that supports a graph of tagged nodes made
    up of sum types and product types, IE an Abstract Syntax Tree. It is made
    out of tensors.

    So for instance, you can encode this program in a neurallambda:

    ((fn [x y z] '(x y z)) 1 2 3)

    And then restore it from the tensor representation all the way back to a
    pretty-printed string. More importantly, while it's a tensor, you can
    compute on it, such as doing the beta-reduction step of the Lambda Calculus.

    Using the Neuralbeta class, the program above can be reduced to:

    '(1 2 3)

    This list of numbers is fully encoded within tensors, but again, can be read
    back out into a human interpretable, pretty-printed program.


    On Symbols:

    How can a discrete symbol live within a tensor, you might ask? Research on
    Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA), and Holographic Reduced Representations
    (HRR) informs this decision. In short, symbols can be jammed into vectors
    and it works great. Any 2 vectors drawn randomly are pseudo-orthogonal,
    meaning, they are very (very) likely to be nearly orthogonal. This allows us
    to use cosine similarity between 2 vectors to see if they represent the same
    symbol. Neat stuff happens in VSAs. For instance, an element-wise sum of 2
    symbols allows them to live in superposition, within one vector of the same
    size as the original vectors. This is lossy, but not too bad, and there are
    strategies for cleaning these up as well, to restore fidelity. Computations
    can also happen within these superposed states, and, well, VSAs may well be
    worth ones time to dig into more thoroughly elsewhere.

    Here, we barely use insights from VSAs to merely treat vectors as symbols,
    and where the encoded symbol can be computed upon, and reconstructed.

# Neuralbeta: A Neurallambda equipped with beta reduction stuff

BRAINSTORMING how to reduce Neurallambdas?:

- [X] Online traversal issue: If you see a base type, pop the stack. The next
  address likely references that base type, so, push it's location back onto the
  stack, and infinite loop.

- [X] solution? include two address-aligned "is_reduced" tensors for col1 and
  col2. It doesn't mark a term, it marks references to terms, as to whether
  they're reduced.

- 2 pass. First traverse tree, push everything into a stack. Second, pop from
  stack only, and reduce as you go. I think this wouldn't support online
  recursion.

- solution? instead of 2 new tensors, how about superposing an address with
  "is_reduced" or "is_not_reduced"?  How to update that value? add the negative,
  scaled by cossim? Look out for addresses that have been noised, because the
  original superposed value will have drifted. (NOTE: Tried, too noisy/lossy)


BRAINSTORMING how to tag `is_(not_)reduced`:

How to store `is_reduced`:

    - [X] Separate tensors for noting which addresses are reduced

        - or one index on the address tensor devoted to `is_(not_)reduced`

    - Superposition of address and an `is_(not_)reduced` tag. In experiments,
      the superposed vecs got too noisy too fast. With Error Correction, this
      idea might be worth revisiting. The generalized version of it says that
      you could congeal any info into one superposed vector, and that could be
      useful.

    - 2 orthogonal sets of address ints. EG replace A(1) with orthogonal vec
      IsReducedA(1)

    - Separate cones of vector space: `is_reduced` could be same address * -1

    - Rotate points above / below a hyperplane (requires ensuring that all
      integers are above some hyperplane

    - Store "is_reduced" in magnitude of vectors


When / how to process `is_reduced`

    - when non-app-fn reduction happens, peek ahead to see if they're reduced?

    - [X] when we've descended to a base type, we know it `is_reduced`, and we
      update every reference to this address simultaneously '''

    '''How to Reduce a Neurallambda?

    HIGH LEVEL:

    Reduce terms at an address if possible, control the stack, return next
    addresses to reduce at. This all must remain differentiable. This means that
    all possible cases are run in superposition at every step, but scaled so
    that incorrect operations have minimal effect on the process.

    DETAILS:

    1. Retrieve values at an address

    2. Three cases:

      A. base case/primitives. Pop the stack, return the address on top of stack
         as the next location to reduce at.

      B. (App (Fn ...) ...). We can try beta reduction!

      C. Non-basecase, Non App-Fn. So, a type that has open address slots.


    NOTE: variable names are all GLOBALLY SCOPED. so when `(App (Fn [x] _) _)`
          is reduced, that `x` will get substituted in the body, BUT ALSO EVERY
          `x` in memory will get substituted too with that specific value. I
          engineered this before inventing this project's Neuralstack, so it had
          to be that way. But with a Neuralstack, local scoping may be
          possible (?) (TODO)

    TODO: marking `is_reduced` has given me some troubles. I have mixed 2
          approaches, problematically:

        1. an approach where I try to read an address and determine if the thing
           is a base type that has been previously marked as reduced.

        2. an approach where base types are never marked as `is_reduced`, but when
           they're found, all references to them are marked as reduced.
